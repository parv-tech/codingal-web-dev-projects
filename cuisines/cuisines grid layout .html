        <H1>Naan</H1>
        <article>Naan is a popular type of leavened flatbread that
            <hr> originates from South Asia, particularly India,
            though
            <hr> it has roots in
            Persian cuisine. Traditionally baked in a
            <hr> tandoor (a cylindrical clay oven), naan is known for its
            <hr> soft,
            pillowy texture
            with slightly crispy, charred
            <hr> edges. It's typically made from white flour, yeast,
            <hr> salt, and yogurt or milk,
            which gives
            it a distinct tang
            <hr> and tenderness. Naan is often served hot and brushed
            <hr>with ghee or butter, and it may be
            topped with
            garlic,
            <hr> herbs, or stuffed with ingredients like cheese or
            <hr> minced meat. While naan is a staple in Indian
            cuisines,
            <hr> it has become popular globally, commonly served with
            <hr> curries, lentils, and grilled meats .

        <h1>Palak paneer</h1>
        <article>
            Palak paneer is a classic North Indian vegetarian dish made from pureed spinach (palak) and paneer, a fresh,
            non-melting
            Indian cheese. The dish features a vibrant green spinach gravy flavored with aromatic spices such as cumin,
            garlic,
            ginger, and garam masala. Paneer cubes are usually lightly fried or added directly into the spinach sauce,
            absorbing the
            rich flavors. Palak paneer is both nutritious and flavorful, offering a good source of protein, iron, and
            calcium. It is
            commonly enjoyed with naan, roti, or rice, and is a staple in Indian households and restaurants alike. Its
            mild, creamy
            taste makes it accessible even to those new to Indian cuisine.

        <h1>Navrattan korma</h1>
        <article>
            Navrattan Korma is a rich and flavorful Indian curry known for its creamy texture and colorful assortment of
            ingredients. The name Navrattan means "nine gems," referring to the traditional inclusion of nine different
            vegetables,
            fruits, or nuts in the dish. Typically made with a mix of vegetables like carrots, peas, potatoes, and bell
            peppers, it
            also includes sweet elements such as pineapple or raisins, along with cashews or almonds for crunch. The
            base is a
            mildly spiced, creamy sauce made from yogurt, cream, or coconut milk, often thickened with ground nuts.
            Navrattan Korma
            is a Mughlai-inspired dish, showcasing the fusion of savory and sweet flavors. It is usually served with
            naan or basmati
            rice and is especially popular at festive or celebratory meals.
        </article>
        <h1>Pakhala</h1>
        <article>
            Pakhala is a traditional fermented rice dish from the eastern Indian state of Odisha, and it's especially
            popular in
            neighboring regions like West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Assam. Made by soaking cooked rice in
            water, often
            overnight, pakhala is typically consumed cold and may be seasoned with salt and sometimes curd (yogurt),
            green chilies,
            or mustard seeds. The soaking process allows slight fermentation, which imparts a tangy flavor and aids in
            digestion. It
            is often served with simple side dishes like fried or mashed vegetables, green chilies, or fish fry. Pakhala
            is
            especially popular during the hot summer months as it cools the body and helps prevent heatstroke. In
            Odisha, March 20
            is even celebrated as Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day), honoring this humble, nourishing dish.

        <h1>Gulab Jamun</h1>
        <article>
            Gulab Jamun is one of the most beloved and iconic desserts in Indian cuisine. These soft, round sweets are
            made from a
            dough of milk solids, usually khoya (reduced milk), mixed with a small amount of flour and sometimes paneer.
            The dough
            is shaped into small balls, deep-fried until golden brown, and then soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup
            flavored with
            cardamom, rose water, or saffron. The name "Gulab Jamun" comes from Persian words: gulab (rose) referring to
            the
            rose-scented syrup, and jamun, a fruit similar in size and color to the sweet. Gulab Jamun is often served
            warm or at
            room temperature and is a staple at festivals, weddings, and celebratory meals across South Asia. Its rich,
            melt-in-the-mouth texture and aromatic sweetness make it a favorite treat for people of all ages.

    <div class="box">
        <div>Kumaoni cuisine comes from the Kumaon region in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand. This hilly region, with its
        cold climate and rugged terrain, has shaped a cuisine that is both minimalistic and deeply comforting. The focus is on
        seasonal and local ingredients — grains like mandua (finger millet), pulses like bhatt (black soybean), and a variety of
        leafy greens that grow in the mountains.
        
        The food here isn’t rich in oil or heavy spices; instead, it emphasizes slow cooking and earthy flavors. One of the
        standout dishes is Bhatt ki Churkani, a hearty black soybean curry simmered slowly with local spices. It's often paired
        with steamed rice or mandua roti. Another staple is Aloo Ke Gutke, spiced potato chunks sautéed in mustard oil and
        flavored with jakhiya (a wild seed similar to mustard seeds that crackles when fried).
        
        Even desserts are tailored to the region’s environment. Jhangora Ki Kheer, made from barnyard millet and milk, is a
        nutritious and mildly sweet dish that’s perfect for cold evenings. Overall, Kumaoni cuisine is built around
        sustainability, simplicity, and deep-rooted tradition — a true reflection of mountain living.</div>
        <div>Along the Konkan coast, Malvani cuisine offers a bold and spicy culinary tradition that’s shaped by the sea and the
        tropical climate. Hailing from parts of Maharashtra and Goa, it blends coconut, kokum, tamarind, and fiery red chilies
        to create robust flavors, especially in seafood and meat dishes.
        
        A classic Malvani dish is Kombdi Vade, spicy chicken curry paired with deep-fried rice flour puris. Seafood lovers prize
        Bombil Fry, where Bombay duck (a delicate lizardfish) is marinated and shallow-fried until crisp. Cooling accompaniments
        like Sol Kadhi, made from kokum and coconut milk, balance the heat. Malvani cuisine is not just about spice but also
        about depth and richness, carried by slow-cooked gravies and traditional techniques.</div>
        <div>From the plains of Assam comes the earthy and lesser-known cuisine of the Bodo community. It is simple, clean, and
        deeply rooted in nature, often using fermented ingredients, wild herbs, and smoked meats. Rice is central to the Bodo
        diet, and pork features prominently, often combined with bamboo shoots or greens.
        
        One iconic dish is Oma Bedor, a pork curry cooked with bamboo shoots, giving it a unique sour and smoky flavor. Another
        staple is Narzi, a slightly bitter pork curry made with dried jute leaves. Bodo cuisine often includes homemade rice
        beer called Sobai Jwng, fermented and enjoyed during social gatherings. There is a strong emphasis on minimal processing
        and cooking close to the earth — a cuisine that remains largely unchanged overgenerations.</div>
        <div>The Saraswat Brahmins, who live along the Konkan coast, have cultivated a cuisine that is both traditional and adaptive.
        Though rooted in vegetarian principles, many Saraswat communities near the sea also consume fish, reflecting a deep
        connection with their environment.
        
        The use of coconut, kokum, jaggery, and local greens gives this cuisine a distinctively sweet-tangy flavor. A
        traditional delicacy is Pathrado, where colocasia leaves are smeared with a spicy rice paste, rolled, steamed, and
        sliced. Another is Mooga Gathi, a gentle curry made with sprouted green gram and coconut. Even simple flatbreads and
        porridges are elevated with coastal ingredients, and many preparations reflect a balance of nutrition and taste honed
        over centuries.
