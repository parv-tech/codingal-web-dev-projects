        <H1>Naan</H1>
        <article>Naan is a popular type of leavened flatbread that
            <hr> originates from South Asia, particularly India,
            though
            <hr> it has roots in
            Persian cuisine. Traditionally baked in a
            <hr> tandoor (a cylindrical clay oven), naan is known for its
            <hr> soft,
            pillowy texture
            with slightly crispy, charred
            <hr> edges. It's typically made from white flour, yeast,
            <hr> salt, and yogurt or milk,
            which gives
            it a distinct tang
            <hr> and tenderness. Naan is often served hot and brushed
            <hr>with ghee or butter, and it may be
            topped with
            garlic,
            <hr> herbs, or stuffed with ingredients like cheese or
            <hr> minced meat. While naan is a staple in Indian
            cuisines,
            <hr> it has become popular globally, commonly served with
            <hr> curries, lentils, and grilled meats .

        <h1>Palak paneer</h1>
        <article>
            Palak paneer is a classic North Indian vegetarian dish made from pureed spinach (palak) and paneer, a fresh,
            non-melting
            Indian cheese. The dish features a vibrant green spinach gravy flavored with aromatic spices such as cumin,
            garlic,
            ginger, and garam masala. Paneer cubes are usually lightly fried or added directly into the spinach sauce,
            absorbing the
            rich flavors. Palak paneer is both nutritious and flavorful, offering a good source of protein, iron, and
            calcium. It is
            commonly enjoyed with naan, roti, or rice, and is a staple in Indian households and restaurants alike. Its
            mild, creamy
            taste makes it accessible even to those new to Indian cuisine.

        <article>
            Navrattan Korma is a rich and flavorful Indian curry known for its creamy texture and colorful assortment of
            ingredients. The name Navrattan means "nine gems," referring to the traditional inclusion of nine different
            vegetables,
            fruits, or nuts in the dish. Typically made with a mix of vegetables like carrots, peas, potatoes, and bell
            peppers, it
            also includes sweet elements such as pineapple or raisins, along with cashews or almonds for crunch. The
            base is a
            mildly spiced, creamy sauce made from yogurt, cream, or coconut milk, often thickened with ground nuts.
            Navrattan Korma
            is a Mughlai-inspired dish, showcasing the fusion of savory and sweet flavors. It is usually served with

        <h1>Pakhala</h1>
        <article>
            Pakhala is a traditional fermented rice dish from the eastern Indian state of Odisha, and it's especially
            popular in
            neighboring regions like West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Assam. Made by soaking cooked rice in
            water, often
            overnight, pakhala is typically consumed cold and may be seasoned with salt and sometimes curd (yogurt),
            green chilies,
            or mustard seeds. The soaking process allows slight fermentation, which imparts a tangy flavor and aids in
            digestion. It
            is often served with simple side dishes like fried or mashed vegetables, green chilies, or fish fry. Pakhala
            is
            especially popular during the hot summer months as it cools the body and helps prevent heatstroke. In
            Odisha, March 20
            is even celebrated as Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day), honoring this humble, nourishing dish.

        <h1>Gulab Jamun</h1>
        <article>
            Gulab Jamun is one of the most beloved and iconic desserts in Indian cuisine. These soft, round sweets are made from a
            dough of milk solids, usually khoya (reduced milk), mixed with a small amount of flour and sometimes paneer. The dough
            is shaped into small balls, deep-fried until golden brown, and then soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup flavored with
            cardamom, rose water, or saffron. The name "Gulab Jamun" comes from Persian words: gulab (rose) referring to the
            rose-scented syrup, and jamun, a fruit similar in size and color to the sweet. Gulab Jamun is often served warm or at
            room temperature and is a staple at festivals, weddings, and celebratory meals across South Asia. Its rich,
            melt-in-the-mouth texture and aromatic sweetness make it a favorite treat for people of all ages.
