Pls take care of them . </b> Honey bees are more than just sweet honey producers — they’re vital players in our ecosystem. These incredible insects
    have been buzzing around for over 100 million years, shaping life on Earth as we know it. From pollinating flowers to
    supporting global agriculture, honey bees are among the most important creatures on the planet. </P>

    <h1>Fascinating facts about honey bees : </h1>

    <ul>

        <li>
            Super pollinators: Honey bees pollinate nearly 80% of all flowering plants, including more than 130 types of fruits and
            vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Colony life: A single hive can contain up to 60,000 bees, each with a specific role — queens lay eggs, workers forage
            and care for the young, and drones mate with queens.
        </li>
        <li>Waggle dance: Bees use a “waggle dance” to communicate the direction and distance to food sources.
        </li>
        <li>
            Incredible memory: Bees can remember and recognize human faces, scents, and specific flower types.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How do honeybees make honey ? </h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Foraging: Worker bees collect nectar from flowers using their long, tube-like tongues.
        </li>
        <li>
            Processing: Back at the hive, the nectar is passed from bee to bee, reducing its water content and breaking down sugars.
        </li>
        <li>
            Storage: The honey is stored in hexagon-shaped wax cells and sealed with a wax cap to preserve it.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Honey is more than just a sweetener — it has antibacterial properties, never spoils, and has been used in traditional
        medicine for centuries.
