        <li><dd>there is a poem from <mark>Vitai Lampada</mark> and it goes like this :
            <pre class="hello">
                        "There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night—
                        Ten to make and the match to win—
                        A bumping pitch and a blinding light,
                        An hour to play and the last man in.
                        And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat,
                        Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,
                        But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote:
                        'Play up! play up! and play the game!'"
